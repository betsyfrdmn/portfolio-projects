Hi! I'm Betsy, and I hold a **B.A. in Economics** and a **B.S. in Applied Mathematics and Statistics**. This repository showcases my work applying machine learning, statistical modeling, and econometric techniques to real-world problems in health, behavior, and markets. I am currently seeking full-time employment. If you're hiring or collaborating on something exciting â€” feel free to connect!

I use **Python**, **R**, and **Excel** to explore and analyze complex datasets. My work spans:
- Predictive modeling
- Neural networks and activation function analysis
- Logistic regression evaluation
- Gradient descent optimization
- Market power estimation
- Production function and cost analysis
- Gene-environment interaction modeling

Iâ€™m especially interested in projects that combine economic insight with technical tools to support data-driven decision-making.


## Project Highlights

### Machine Learning (Python)
- **Obesity Prediction with ML**: Compared various models (logistic regression, decision trees, neural networks) to predict obesity risk.
- **Best Activation Functions for NNs**: Tested ReLU, tanh, sigmoid, etc., to evaluate model performance in classification tasks.
- **Gradient Descent Prediction**: Applied custom gradient descent for sequence forecasting.

### Econometrics & Data Analysis (R)
- **Market Power & Marginal Cost Estimation**: Used structural econometrics to analyze competition in the automotive market.
- **Production Function Analysis**: Estimated firm-level output response to inputs using flexible functional forms.
- **Gene-Environment Interactions**: Modeled regression effects of genetic and environmental variables on outcomes.

### Excel Modeling
- **Multiple Regression Analysis**: Built models for real-world datasets to evaluate multivariate relationships.
